# ðŸ“Š Statistics for Data Science: A Comprehensive Resource
Welcome to the Statistics for Data Science open-source repository! This project is designed to be a comprehensive resource for those learning or working in data science, providing foundational to advanced topics in statistics. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to be a go-to reference.

# ðŸš€ Project Overview
Statistics is a core component of data science and machine learning. From understanding data distributions to conducting hypothesis testing and building statistical models, this repository covers key statistical concepts and their practical applications in data science.

Key Topics Covered:
Descriptive Statistics: Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and data visualization techniques.
Probability Theory: Basic probability, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson, etc.).
Inferential Statistics: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-values.
Statistical Models: Linear and logistic regression, ANOVA, and time series analysis.
Sampling Methods: Techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, and bootstrapping.
Advanced Topics: Bayesian statistics, Markov chains, and Monte Carlo simulations.
Statistical Computing: Implementation in Python, R, and other popular libraries (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, statsmodels, etc.).
